# Visual basic math

We need to get some things calculated, so let's get to work.

Hit the problem endpoint and grab the image URL. The image will be a few lines of numbers and operations that you need to perform. Start with `0`, go from top to bottom and figure out the final result. Careful! The numbers may get big. Make sure nothing overflows along the way.

To illustrate, an image roughly equivalent to:

```
+ 12 
- 10  
× 2
```

Should be treated as `(((0 + 12) - 10) × 2)` which equals `4`.

_A word on division:_ for `÷`, the challenge uses floor division which may be slightly surprising. Floor division means that after dividing the numbers, the result is rounded **down**. This means that `-10 ÷ 3` is equal `-4` (the `floor` of `-3.(3)` is `-4`)! Keep this quirk in mind.

Submit the final result the the solution endpoint. It's done!

##### Getting the problem set

`GET /challenges/visual_basic_math/problem?access_token=<access_token>`

Problem JSON:

- `image_url`: the URL of the image we want you to process

##### Submitting a solution

`POST /challenges/visual_basic_math/solve?access_token=<access_token>`

Solution JSON structure:

- `result`: the result of all the math

##### Why this challenge?

It's always interesting to make a computer really read things.
