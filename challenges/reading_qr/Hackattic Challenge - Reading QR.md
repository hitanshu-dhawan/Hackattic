# Reading QR

Connect to the problem endpoint, grab the image with a QR code from the returnedÂ `image_url`. The code contains a hyphen-formatted, numeric code.

Your task is to parse the QR code and submit the resulting code.

That's it, it's practically free points!

##### Getting the problem set

`GET /challenges/reading_qr/problem?access_token=<access_token>`

Problem JSON format will be in the following format:

- `image_url`: URL to the image with the QR code

##### Submitting a solution

`POST /challenges/reading_qr/solve?access_token=<access_token>`

Solution JSON structure:

- `code`: the code contained in the QR

##### Why this challenge?

I had this one stashed away in git for ages. It's a pretty simple challenge, with the only twist being the rotation of the code - but there are many simple ways you can tackle that part. Even brute-force'y. Why not?

# Solution

-- Generated by ChatGPT.

[`pyzbar`](https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/) is a Python wrapper for the [`ZBar`](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/) library, which allows you to decode barcodes and QR codes from images.

### Installation

To use `pyzbar`, you first need to install it along with its dependencies:

```sh
pip install pyzbar
```

### Reading QR Code from an Image

Here's a simple Python script to read a QR code from an image:

```python
from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode
from PIL import Image

# Load the image
image = Image.open("qrcode.png")  # Replace with your QR code image file

# Decode the QR code
decoded_objects = decode(image)

# Print the results
for obj in decoded_objects:
    print("Data:", obj.data.decode("utf-8"))  # Decoded text from QR code
    print("Type:", obj.type)  # Barcode type (e.g., 'QRCODE')
```

### Summary

- `pyzbar` is a wrapper for `ZBar`, allowing QR code and barcode decoding.
- It works with images (`PIL.Image`) and real-time video (`OpenCV`).
- Supports multiple barcode types including `QRCODE`, `EAN`, `UPC`, etc.
